            <h2 class="embossed">What is IPTV?</h2>
            <p>
                IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a system where television services are delivered via the Internet rather than through traditional terrestrial, satellite, or cable television formats. By using IPTV, users can watch live TV channels, series, and movies on-demand through a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and personal computers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="embossed">How IPTV Works</h2>
            <p>
                When you subscribe to our IPTV service, you'll receive a unique ID and password. These credentials allow you to access your personalized IPTV account through a player that works both on PC and mobile devices. Once logged in, you can instantly stream live channels and watch the latest series and movies directly on your device.
            </p>
